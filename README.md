## About IRISPass
IRISPass is a free & open source software. It helps create and maintain secure, randomised passwords. It is cross platform and the binaries are available for MacOS / Windows / Linux / Android. It also supports password syncing across Desktop and Mobile devices.

## Generating Passwords
1. Setup a secure master password. Make sure that it is NOT easy to guess. A good example of a strong password would be 8 - 20 characters long, including uppercase and lowercase characters and special symbols

## Master Password
All the passwords which are either generated by the app or entered by the user are saved in device's storage. IRISPass does not possess a server and all of your data resides on devices that you own. The passwords are encrypted with your Master Password before it is saved in device. Hence, without the master password, one can not get access to your passwords. Thus, it is of utmost importance that the Master Password should NOT be easy to guess. IRISPass doesn't save your Master Password for security reasons, it will ask for it from time to time to ensure maximum security. Optionally, you can enable Biometric Authentication to avoid entering Master Password every time.

## Syncing
IRISPass stores all your password data in the device itself. Syncing passwords is still possible even if your devices are not connected to any servers. The catch here is that the devices need to be in the same network. Syncing is possible between your Desktop & Mobile app. To sync passwords, you'll need to click QR Code button from your Desktop app. You'll be able to see a QR Code on screen. From your mobile app, click sync button to open camera. Point your camera towards the QR Code and that should be it! To ensure that the passwords can not be stolen by someone else, IRISPass performs a "handshake" with your Email and Master Password. Hence, for password sync to work, the Email and Master Passwords should be the same both the devices
